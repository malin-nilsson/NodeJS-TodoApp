This was a school assignment where the goal was to develop skills in Node.js, Express.js, routing and templating with Handlebars.

All tasks should have the following attributes:
- Id
- Created (date & time) 
- Description
- Done (true / false)

The objective was for users to be able to perform all CRUD operations on todos, display tasks depending on completed/not completed, and sort tasks based on when they were created, newest → oldest and oldest → newest.
